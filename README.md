1. Core Value Proposition
For Customers: A one-stop solution to hire trusted professionals for home maintenance, repairs, and construction projects.

2. Key Features & Services
The platform is divided into clear service categories:

Home Services: Cleaning, Appliance Repair, Pest Control, Movers.
Skilled Trades: Electricians, Plumbers, Painters.
Construction & Daily Labor: A dedicated focus on "Construction Labour" and "Shop Helpers", distinguishing it from typical home service apps.

3. User Experience (Dual-Role System)
The application has distinct flows for two user types:

User (Customer):
Goal: Hire workers or book services.
Features: Browse categories, view service details, add to cart/book services, and manage profile.
Worker (Professional):
